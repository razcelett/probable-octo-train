  <h2>Baguio City</h2>
  <p>
    Baguio is a city tucked away in a mountainous region on Luzon Island. It  is called the City of Pines for the rich pine forests and cooler temperatures that surround it. Baguio is unique to other destinations in the Philippines because the city is surrounded by trees and not water. Parks like Mines View and Burnham let you enjoy some of the flora and fauna that are special to this region.

  <h2>Cebu City</h2>
  <p>
    The island of Cebu, in the central Visayas region, is considered the port to some of the best diving and snorkeling in the Philippines. Some of the most spectacular scenery from the water near Cebu are the sea caves that attract photographers and outdoor enthusiasts looking for unique diving and snorkeling sites. The Sudlon National Park is a breathtaking park to explore and hike.  While Cebu's greatest draw is its water, Cebu City is a metropolitan area, with tourist attractions like museums and cathedrals that will interest history buffs.

  <h2>Coron Island</h2>
  <p>
    One of the top diving destinations in the world, Coron Island is a tropical paradise, with electric blue and green water that almost seems unreal. The mountainous island sits on the tip of the Palawan island region, the western-most section of islands in the Philippines. The island is popular for diving because of the numerous wrecks here.

  <h2>Manila</h2>
  <p>
    The Philippines capital of Manila, on the island of Luzon, is a bustling city with non-stop activity. Usually over-packed with locals, the bumpy ride through the streets on the iconic and kitschy jeep/bus hybrid vehicles will be one of the highlights of your visit. Plan stops to the main park in the city, Rizal Park, and the historical San Agustin Church that was built in the 16th century.

  <h2>Sagada</h2>
  <p>
    One of the most unique experiences you can have in the Philippines is in the northern tribal region in Sagada. Nestled in the rugged and remote Cordillera Mountains are tribes that embrace the occasional visitor. One of the best places to visit in this region of the Philippines is the hanging coffins that hide deep in the mountains. It is best to connect with a local guide to take you to this incredible site because this is not a tourist area, but rather an authentic tribal region hiding an experience worthy of bragging rights.
